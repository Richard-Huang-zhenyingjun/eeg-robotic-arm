# Week 1 Log - Simulation Foundation

**Date Range:** September 18-19, 2024  
**Phase:** Phase 1 (SIM) - Foundation & Robotics in Simulation

## ‚úÖ Accomplishments

### Day 1: Environment Setup
- [x] Docker container configured with ROS2 Humble (`saching12/ros-mac-m1:humble-desktop`)
- [x] PyBullet installed for physics simulation
- [x] X11 forwarding attempted (issues with GUI on macOS/Docker)
- [x] Fallback to headless (DIRECT) mode for PyBullet

### Day 2: Repository Initialization
- [x] GitHub repository created: `eeg-robotic-arm`
- [x] Project structure scaffolded (bci/, robot/, bridge/, configs/, etc.)
- [x] README.md with project overview
- [x] .gitignore configured for Python/ROS2/Arduino
- [x] Development on `develop` branch established

### Day 3: Workspace Build
- [x] ROS2 workspace created at `~/eeg-robotic-arm/robot/ros2_ws`
- [x] Custom package `arm_sim` created
- [x] Colcon build successful
- [x] Test node verified working

### Day 4: Robot Simulation
- [x] 4-DOF URDF model created (`simple_arm.urdf`)
- [x] PyBullet simulation node implemented
- [x] ROS2 topics publishing joint states
- [x] Keyboard control node created
- [x] Full control pipeline tested

### Day 5: Integration Testing
- [x] Multi-node system verified
- [x] Keyboard control ‚Üí PyBullet ‚Üí Joint States pipeline working
- [x] ASCII visualizer created for headless monitoring
- [x] Documentation updated

## üöß Challenges & Solutions

### Issue 1: X11 Forwarding on macOS
- **Problem:** PyBullet GUI mode failed with X11/OpenGL errors
- **Solution:** Switched to DIRECT (headless) mode, created ASCII visualizer
- **Future:** Consider VNC or web-based visualization

### Issue 2: Container Naming Confusion
- **Problem:** Multiple container names (ros2-sim, ros2-sim-gui)
- **Solution:** Standardized on `ros2-sim-gui`
- **Learning:** Better container management practices needed

### Issue 3: Duplicate Nodes
- **Problem:** Multiple instances of same nodes running
- **Solution:** Killed all processes and restarted cleanly
- **Prevention:** Always use Ctrl+C to stop nodes properly

/joint_states
/joint_commands### Working Commands:
- Simulation: `ros2 run arm_sim pybullet_sim`
- Control: `ros2 run arm_sim keyboard_control`
- Monitor: `ros2 topic echo /joint_states`

## üõçÔ∏è Hardware Status
- **Note:** Currently in full simulation mode
- No hardware ordered yet (following virtual Phase 1)
- Hardware shopping list prepared for future:
  - OpenBCI Cyton Board
  - 4x MG996R servos
  - Arduino Uno + PCA9685
  - Power supply and safety components

## üìà Metrics
- ROS2 Nodes: 2 (pybullet_arm_sim, keyboard_control)
- Topics: 4 (/joint_commands, /joint_states, /rosout, /parameter_events)
- Control DOF: 4 joints
- Update Rate: 20 Hz (joint states)
- Simulation Rate: 240 Hz (PyBullet)

## üéØ Next Week Plan (Week 2)

### Goals:
1. **Custom Robot Design**
   - Refine URDF with realistic dimensions
   - Add joint limits and safety constraints
   - Implement velocity/acceleration limits

2. **Advanced Control**
   - Create joint trajectory controller
   - Add smooth motion interpolation
   - Implement safety stop functionality

3. **BCI Preparation**
   - Research SSVEP signal processing
   - Design frequency detection architecture
   - Create mock EEG data generator

4. **Visualization Improvements**
   - Attempt web-based visualizer
   - Create joint state plots
   - Add performance metrics display

## üîë Key Learnings
1. Docker on macOS requires special handling for GUI applications
2. Headless simulation is sufficient for control testing
3. ROS2 workspace management is critical for package building
4. Multiple terminal coordination needed for distributed nodes
