Issues Encountered and Solutions
1. Visualization Performance
Issue: Initial matplotlib updates were slow and caused UI freezing
 Impact: Poor user experience, sluggish command response
 Solution:
Implemented plt.ion() for interactive mode
Added plt.pause(0.01) for forced updates
Optimized rendering by updating only changed elements
Code Fix:
# Before: Full plot recreation each update
def update_plot(self):
    plt.clf()  # Clear entire plot - SLOW
    # Redraw everything...

# After: Selective element updates  
def update_plot(self):
    self.line.set_data_3d(x_coords, y_coords, z_coords)  # FAST
    self.joint_dots.set_data_3d(x_coords, y_coords, z_coords)
    plt.draw()

2. Joint Limit Consistency
Issue: Joint limits were sometimes inconsistently enforced
 Impact: Arm could occasionally exceed intended limits
 Solution:
Centralized limit checking in ArmDriver
Added validation in set_joint_angles() method
Implemented both soft warnings and hard clamping
Implementation:
def _handle_left_command(self):
    new_angle = self.joint_angles[0] + self.base_increment
    min_angle, max_angle = self.joint_limits[0]
    
    if new_angle > max_angle:
        self._logger.warning(f"Limit exceeded, clamping to {max_angle}°")
        new_angle = max_angle
    
    self.joint_angles[0] = new_angle

3. Import Path Management
Issue: Python import errors when running scripts from different directories
 Impact: Development workflow disruption
 Solution:
Added dynamic path resolution in all scripts
Used relative imports where appropriate
Created consistent project structure
Path Fix:
# Added to all integration scripts
import sys
import os
script_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
project_root = os.path.join(script_dir, '..')
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(project_root, 'sim'))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(project_root, 'robot'))

4. Command Processing Latency
Issue: Noticeable delay between command input and visual response
 Impact: Poor real-time feel, debugging difficulty
 Solution:
Profiled each component to identify bottlenecks
Optimized matplotlib update frequency
Added debug timing information
Performance Optimization:
# Added timing instrumentation
import time
start_time = time.time()
# ... processing ...
elapsed = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
if self.debug_mode:
    self.logger.info(f"Command processed in {elapsed:.1f}ms")

5. State Synchronization
Issue: Occasional desynchronization between MockSerial state and ArmDriver state
 Impact: Inconsistent system state reporting
 Solution:
Implemented centralized state management
Added state validation checkpoints
Created explicit synchronization methods
Synchronization Fix:
def process_serial_command(self, command_bytes):
    # Process through both components
    mock_response = self.mock_serial.write(command_bytes)
    driver_success = self.arm_driver.process_command(command_str)
    
    # Verify state consistency
    if driver_success:
        self._validate_state_sync()
